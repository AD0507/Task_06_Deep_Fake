## Street Interview Video Project
This project showcases how AI tools were used to create a street interview–style video set in Times Square, New York City, focusing on tech job seekers. The workflow combined text-based AI for dialogue generation, Google VO3 (Flow application) for short video segments, and CapCut for final editing.

## Project Goal

- Simulate a 20–25 second street interview dialogue between a reporter and a job seeker in tech.

- Capture the noisy, energetic Times Square vibe.

- Demonstrate the use of AI text + AI video tools to create engaging short-form content.

## Future Improvements

- Explore tools that allow longer continuous scenes (beyond 8 seconds) in future and check out paid versions. 

- Automate role consistency (mic handover, positioning).

- Experiment with different interview variations (sports interview, data interview based on the analysis done).

## Acknowledgments

- ChatGPT for generating interview scripts.

- Google VO3 (Flow Application) for AI video generation.

- CapCut for editing and merging final clips.
